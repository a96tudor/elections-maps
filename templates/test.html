    <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
    <p>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br/>
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br/>
      when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br/>
      It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br/>
      It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br/>
      and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
    <p>
      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br/>
      It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br/>
      making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, <br/>
      looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, <br/>
      and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <br/>
      Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"<br/>
      (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, <br/>
      very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
